	<p>It is sometimes convenient to associate a real number, or other mathematical object, with each outcome of a random experiment.  The notion of a random variable formalizes this idea.</p>

	<p> Now I'm going to try to do some math.  Here's an equation that I like: <m>X: \Omega \to S</m>.  Here's a displayed math equation.
	<me>
		P[X=x]=\sum_{\omega \in X^{-1}({s})}P(\omega).
	</me>
	That's all I've got!</p>
